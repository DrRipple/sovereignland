# Prussian Elections Tomorrow
With the Prussian Chancellor elections being held tomorrow, both Chancellor Adrian Streckenbach and far-right challenger Ralf Ratzenberger squared off in a debate yesterday evening, the most viewed television program in years.

Streckenbach's main strategy was to paint Ratzenberger as a remnant of a bygone era in Prussian politics: a Nazi. This strategy seems to have worked, as polls immediately following the debate show Streckenbach with a strong lead over his opponent. In addition, Ratzenberger's position on Bavarian independence (which his party, the BNP, supports) has remained unclear, and has further hampered his progress in appealing to a wider base.

However, Ratzenberger did have strong moments in the debate, mainly when he discussed the doing away with the status-quo which, he says, &quot;has failed the Prussian people for so long&quot;.

Even as Ratzenberger's anti-establishment message appeals to some, few seem to be able to overlook his intensely anti-immigrant (and even at times, anti-Semitic) rhetoric. The country will decide tomorrow on who the next Chancellor will be.
