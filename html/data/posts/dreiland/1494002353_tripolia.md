# Feds Take Tripoli, Surrounding Areas

The federal government, based in Tunis, has succeeded in taking the city of Tripoli and most central states back from Al Hurria control. As many as 3500 federal troops fought with separatist militant groups over the past week. While victory in Tripoli came easily with few casualties, regaining control of the east, including Benghazi, is expected to be much more difficult.

In 2006, Al Hurria gained a plurality of seats in the Benghazi state legislature. The other parties set aside their differences and formed a center-right/center-left coalition against the terrorist group. As the federal government threatened to interfere to remove Al Hurria from the legislature entirely, the group employed its militia to assasinate a number of opposition leaders and prevent representatives from entering the legislature.

Al Hurria forcefully controls much of east Tripolia with an iron grip. The previous largest attack by the group was in 2013 when three policemen and a number of civilians were shot outside of the Tunis International Airport by terrorists. Over the years, the federal government has occasionally conducted air strikes against isolated targets, but never a land invasion.
