President Pierre Dubois of Tripolia called the initial operation in Tripoli a &quot;tremendous success&quot; and assured &quot;the city of Tripoli will be retaken promptly.&quot; A number of federal planes carrying troops and military supplies landed in the Tripoli Airport since its seizure by the federal government. During the operation early this morning, 8 soldiers were injured and 0 were killed.

# Criticism of Prussian Strike

The president also demanded that Prussia withdraw from Tripolian waters and cease operations in the country. &quot;While it is appreciated that others are willing to help, it is absolutely unacceptable for another nation to fire missiles into our land without our permission,&quot; he said during the press briefing. Sources indicate that civilians may have been injured in the Prussian missile strike, and a number of nearby properties received moderate to severe damage.
