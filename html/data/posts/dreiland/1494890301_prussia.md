# Adrian Streckenbach Handily Defeats Opponent Ralf Ratzenberger in Chancellor Race
Chancellor Adrian Streckenbach has defeated his opponent, Ralf Ratzenberger, in the race for the Chancellorship of Prussia on Sunday.

Streckenbach received a commanding 88% of the vote, with Ratzenberger getting a woefully bad 12%. 

The re-election of Streckenbach is seen as a rejection of the far-right populism that has sprung up across Europe in recent years.

The real test, however, will come during the legislative elections in July, where Ratzenberger's BNP is expected to make significant gains in the Bundestag and Bundesrat.
