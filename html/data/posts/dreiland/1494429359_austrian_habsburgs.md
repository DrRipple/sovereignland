# Nationalists storm Parliament

On May 1 at approximately 9:00 in the morning, 62 armed individuals stormed the Austrian Habsburg Parliament in New Vienna parliament. According to some reports by pedestrians nearby, the group began firing once inside the Building's main hall, before setting up barricades to block the main entrance. 

Police and SWAT units arrived at the scene at 9:25 and promptly evacuated the surrounding areas of Reichsratsstraße, Rathausplatz, Doktor-Karl-Renner-Ring, and Schmerlingplatz. Additionally, New Vienna's Municipal Police Department and the Sicherheitsministerium (Ministry of Security) have issued a notice urging all citizens in and around New Vienna to stay in their homes and to avoid travel. All highways entering and exiting the capital have been closed off by police. 

Police Chief Ernst Streseman has told reporters that &quot;120 MPs are being held hostage by the terrorists, who are believed to be a wing of the Neo-Nazi group 'Österreich Erwache'.&quot; He continued; &quot;We have already sent negotiators into the building, and we have been informed that the terrorist cells are willing to cooperate if we meet their demands and release Hans Horvath. As of now, we will not accept these terms.&quot;

Hans Horvath is the leader of the Austrian Habsburg far-right political party AFÖ, and was arrested last week on charges of collaborating with Neo-Nazi organizations.

President Karl Fischer gave a speech to the people of Austrian Habsburgs on National Television in which he declared that &quot;under no circumstances will Austrian Habsburgs capitulate to these Neo-Nazis causing terror. We have suffered as a result of such right-wing extremism before, and we will not permit History to repeat itself!&quot;
