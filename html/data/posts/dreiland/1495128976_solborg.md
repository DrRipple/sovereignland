# President Andersson Suspected of Corruption

Solborg's 5th president, Johan Andersson of the center-right Alternative Party, has recently been accused of high-level corruption following reports that his administration instructed the Taxation Agency not to follow up on debts owed by a number of large banks, including Nordbanken, the largest in Scandinavia. Early estimates show that banks may have been able to avoid up to 21 billion kronor in taxes over the past two years.

Some members of the Riksdag have suggested impeaching the President, which would require a majority of the Riksdag, an investigation by the independent Judicial and Integrity Board, and a trial in the Supreme Court. Impeachment of a president has never been formally considered since the current constitution was adopted in 1975.
