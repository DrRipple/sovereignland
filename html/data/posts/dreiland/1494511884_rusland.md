# Rusland Prepares Offensive

Several naval vessels from the Rusland Federation have been stationed in the Sea of Azov following the recent events in Sovyetska. Troops have also been stationed in the city of Taman, located in the Kerch Strait. A spokesperson for the Federation's Armed Forces said that these actions are a warning to Sovyetska to back down with its actions toward Vaustnie. Others speculate that the Sovyetska/Vaustnie situation may only be an excuse for Rusland to take back Crimea, something it has hinted at wanting in the past.
