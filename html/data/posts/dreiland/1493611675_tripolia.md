# Battle of Tripoli

At 02:54 local time, an estimated 800 Tripolian federal paratroopers landed in and seized the area of Qaser Bin Ghashir, including the Tripoli International Airport. Citizens reported hearing military officers instructing people to remain indoors and away from windows amid occasional gunfire. At least 5 federal soldiers were injured in the operation; the number of enemy casualties is currently unknown. The president is expected to comment on the issue later in the morning during a scheduled press briefing.
