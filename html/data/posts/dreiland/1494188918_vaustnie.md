# Vaustnien Prime Minister Demands Sovyetskan Government to demilitarize the border

Prime Minister Jakub Lisiewicz has just concluded his &quot;National Security Adress&quot; at the Ministerial Palace in Warsaw. 
&quot;The attempt at threatening the Vaustnien Republic with a militarized border is not only contemptible but pathetic. I am demanding that the Sovyetskans  back down, or they will suffer the consequences of their actions&quot;

It seems now that the Sovyetskan Leaders have backed themselves into a corner, either they revoke the military presence along the border and face the embarrassment of submitting to a foreign government or continue to maintain troops in the area and risk escalating the conflict.
