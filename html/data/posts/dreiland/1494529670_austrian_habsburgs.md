# MPs rescued by Police, Government Shutdown

Last night, SWAT units from the New Vienna Municipal Police Department besieged the Austrian Habsburg Parliament building and rescued the 120 MPs that were being held captive by terrorist cells inside. 

The assault started at 22:30, and lasted for nearly an hour whilst 30 officers cleared the entirety of Parliament and engaged the extremists. A spokesperson of the Police department told members of the press that &quot;the police department did not suffer any casualties, however one representative was shot by the terrorists after the SWAT Units reached the main hall.&quot;
The MP in question was Michael Grabner from Villach, 52. The Parliamentary Committee in charge of the financial earnings of Representatives has offered compensation to the MP's family. 

According to further information disclosed by the Informationsministerium (Ministry of Information) and the Police Department, 43 of the 62 assailants were neutralized in the process, though contrary to prior reports, only 13 were actually armed with firearms. 

In response to this tragic event that has unfolded over the course of nearly three days, the Bundespresident Karl Fischer has announced a total government shutdown over the weekend, and the subsequent postponement of the 2017 Federal election. Austrian Habsburg participation in the European Organization will continue, however most other Foreign activities and all domestic affairs will be halted.

Following the news, one concerned citizen in Schwechat told ORF 1; &quot;May God have mercy on us all!&quot;
