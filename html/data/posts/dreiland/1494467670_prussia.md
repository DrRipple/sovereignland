# BNP Candidate Makes it to Second Round
Ralf Ratzenberger, the far-right candidate from the Bavarian Nationalist Party (BNP) has won a spot in the runoff election this Sunday against current Chancellor Adrian Streckenbach of the Liberal Party (LP). 

The result comes as a surprise to all in the Prussian political arena, who believed Elli Hackl, the Capitalist Part (KP)'s candidate would defeat the newcomer easily.

Ratzenberger had increased in popularity in recent weeks, doubling down on his harsh, anti-immigration stance, and advocating for Prussia's exit from the European Organization. 

Ratzenberger received roughly 35% of the vote, trailed by Hackl (who received roughly 20%) and led by Chancellor Streckenbach, who won 45% of the vote. 

Although Ratzenberger has become more popular, he will need to appeal to more moderate voters if he wants a chance at beating Streckenbach, whose popularity is at an all-time high.
