# Secular School in Tunis Bombed

Islamist separatists in Tripolia set off two bombs at a federal secondary school in the nation's de-facto capital, Tunis, earlier today. As of initial reports, 13 people have been confirmed dead, including 11 students. An estimated 70-90 others were taken to hospitals with moderate to severe injuries. Shortly after the blasts, Al Hurria, a known terrorist organization based in Benghazi, claimed responsibility.

Al Hurria has carried out a number of attacks on federal targets in the past, although never on a school. The organization currently controls the legislatures in a number of eastern states, including Tripoli, despite being declared unconstitutional in 1997 and a terrorist organization in 2004 by the federal supreme court. The group seeks to depose the secular federal government and establish an Islamic caliphate in Africa.

President Pierre Dubois issued a statement calling the attack &quot;a despicable act of war by savage killers&quot; and ensured that military action &quot;will be taken to dispose of this menace,&quot; referring to Al Hurria. No comment has been made by the Solborgian government, which is known for its strong support of the federal government in Tripolia.
