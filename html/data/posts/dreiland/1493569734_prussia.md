# Prussia Responds to Al Hurrian Bombing

The Prussian Secretary of State, Gert Höller, has announced that the country has taken military action in response to Al Hurria's &quot;barbaric&quot; bombing of a school in Tripolia.

Höller said that Prussian warships stationed on the island of Malta were alerted shortly after the bombing took place, and sent to conduct a &quot;surgical strike&quot; against a known Al Hurria compound outside of Benghazi. 

Hours later, the SMS Bismarck and SMS Tirpitz launched a total of 20 missiles at the compound, &quot;killing an estimated 80 Al Hurria jihadists&quot; DT reports. 

Although the international response is unknown as of yet, it is expected that Prussia's fellow EO members will be supportive of such actions as a way of curbing terrorism.
