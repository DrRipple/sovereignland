# Hans Horvath arrested over claims of Neo-Nazism

Austrian Habsburg police have arrested Hans Horvath at his residence in Stockerau over claims alleging the far-right leader's involvement with a known Neo-Nazi group, &quot;Österreich Erwache.&quot;

A spokesperson for the New Vienna Municipal Police department stated that &quot;an investigation into the Neo-Nazi terrorist organization has revealed links to the far-right political party, AFÖ, in the form of monetary donations and a series of phone calls indicating a coordinated effort subvert the federal government of Austrian Habsburgs.&quot; When asked by ORF 1 reporters, he refused to provide any specific findings, clarifying that the matter was still under further investigation.

Hans Horvath is set to appear before court in New Vienna preceding next month's election. Pundits are now referring to this incident as &quot;the most devastating blow to Far-right politics since the end of World War II.&quot; Under Austrian Habsburgs' Anti-terrorism law, Mr. Horvath may face up to 12 years in prison. The law was originally drafted in 1945, and bans any organizations associated with National Socialism. 

The Parliament cites this arrest as a successful operation against the &quot;prevailing menace of Nazism&quot;, however many Austrians from across the political spectrum have criticized the publicity of the event, saying that the government and media are merely &quot;giving these fringe groups a platform to broadcast their hatred,&quot; as one concerned citizen in Brno told ORF 1.

Whether or not this affair will have an impact on the results of the next presidential election remains to be seen. However, most agree that this has been a grim reminder of Austrian Habsburgs' past, and it has everyone glued to their televisions asking one question; What next?
