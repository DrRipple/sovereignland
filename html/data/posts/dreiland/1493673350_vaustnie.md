# Newly Elected Vaustnien PM declares Sovyetska the &quot;Enemy of Democracy&quot;

The New Vaustnien Prime Minister Jakub Lisiewicz was inaugurated in the Vaustnien parliamentary capital Warsaw joined by a crowd of over 367,000 citizens.

The new Vaustnien leader marks an interesting turn in the modern-day political climate of the Eastern Republic towards a more nationalistic ideology following the first victory of the Narodowa Partia Demokratyczna (NPD) in any major governmental election as well as the same party gaining a majority within the Lower Parliament.

&quot;Today, my fellow citizens, we mark the beginning of the rise of Vaustnie!&quot; the crowd interrupted with applause. &quot;Vaustnie has, since time immemorial, been the bastion of democratic ideals and practices...This is why in this day and age it is still incredibly concerning to see such widespread ideological suppression in so close to our nation. The Socialist Order of Sovyetska has proven time and time again to not only be the enemy of the Vaustnien but to the idea of liberty and Democracy itself! They must either end their policing of ideologies or we will be forced to end it ourselves&quot; The Crowd Breaks out into loud applause and cheering

Politicians of two out of the three major parties (CSP and MPV) have noted that this kind of behavior is only for show and to gather support from the radicals and that it will in no way be acted upon. Others fear that his radical positions on &quot;enforced democracy&quot; will only pave a bleak and frightening path for the Vaustnien people.
