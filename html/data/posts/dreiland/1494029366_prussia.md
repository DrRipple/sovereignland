# Prussian Elections Intensify Amid Neo-Nazi Findings in Austrian Habsburgs

The Prussian elections for both the legislature and Chancellorship have intensified amid the arrest of alleged Neo-Nazi Hans Horvath in neighboring Austrian Habsburgs.

Although Nazism has long been been a source of shame for the Prussian people since the end of World War II, far-right movements have been increasingly popular in the last few years as people all over the country become disgruntled with the status quo. The Bavarian  Nationalist Party (BNP) has been particularly prominent within right-wing politics, giving the dominant center-right Capitalist Party (KP)cause for concern.

On the left, both the Liberal Party (LP), supported by Chancellor Adrian Streckenbach, and the Prussian Socialist Party (PSP) have condemned the BNP's anti-immigrant and anti-Semitic rhetoric as &quot;Verr√ºckt&quot; (crazy).

Chancellor Streckenbach will likely face Elli Hackl from the Capitalists, even as the BNP candidate, Ralf Ratzenberger grows in popularity. The first round will be held on May 7th, with the second round one week later (along with the elections for the legislature).
