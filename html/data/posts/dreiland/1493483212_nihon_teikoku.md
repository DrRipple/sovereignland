# NEW BUDGET PLAN

Last night, Prime-Minister Hachiro Tanaka announced that the Imperial Parliament has voted to increase defense spending in the new budget plan.

One Representative told a reporter of NHTK World that &quot;we believe that with the deteriorating situation in the Korean Peninsula, it is important that we maintain security in the region,&quot; referring to mounting protests in Pyongyang and Seoul over food shortages. 

Additionally, the new budget plan will also increase National spending on Scientific research. Controversially, this move is also aimed at developing the military of Nihon Teikoku, specifically the Imperial navy which to date still uses equipment from the Second World War.

Overall, it seems as though the new plan is largely determined to improve and bolster the Imperial Army. Critics call this &quot;part of a hidden agenda to return to the old ways&quot;, a claim which government officials have denied on several occasions.
