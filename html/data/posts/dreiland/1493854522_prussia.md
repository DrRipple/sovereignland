# Prussian Stance on Vaustnie/Soyvetska Tensions

Although Prussia and Vaustnie have long been rivals since the breakup of the USPR and its allies in the late 80's and early 90's, Adrian Streckenbach, Chancellor of Prussia, has said he is &quot;committed to protecting all EO allies from any sort of attack&quot; and that &quot;Prussia stands by Vaustnie in this turbulent time&quot;.

The Soyvetskan response is still unknown.
