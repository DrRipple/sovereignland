# AFÖ backs Vaustnien PM, Jakub Lisiewicz

Leader of Austrian Habsburgs' far-right nationalist party &quot;Alternative für Österreich&quot;, Hans Horvath, recently gave an interview with ORF 1 in which he declared his support for the controversial Vausnien PM, Jakub Lisiewicz, and his latest remarks on the Socialist Order of Sovyetska.

Mr. Horvath stated that &quot;Sovyetska poses and existential threat to Democracy and Freedom in Europe.&quot;

He continued; &quot;Vaustnie is already facing military backlash for simply speaking out against the regime of Sovyetska. As a European people, we must stand up and defend ourselves from these communist warmongers that seek the destruction of our values.&quot; 

Polling conducted after the interview indicates that the mounting tensions in Eastern Europe have lead to increased support for the populist AFÖ. As of now, Hans Horvath is expected to gain at least 19% of the popular vote in next month's presidential election.

Current Bundespräsident, Karl Fischer, has not yet commented on the Vaustnien/Sovyetskan crisis.
