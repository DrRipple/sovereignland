# Sovyetska has threatened to militarise the border with Vaustnie

After the Prime Minister of Vaustnie had insulted Sovyetska, the nation has threatened to militarise the border and possibly invade if all claims are taken back. The military has already been mobilised and are moving to the border, however are permitted to stop if Vaustnie backs down. President Ariebham has been interviewed about the response.

&quot;We will not take to such bullying from nations for no reason. We are ready to attack if a nation dares to insult us, with no casus belli. Vaustnie will pay for their actions if they ever do this again. They call us the enemy of democracy; we call them the enemy of socialism,&quot; the President has said.
