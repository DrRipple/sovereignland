United Arkadia is a huge, wealthy technocracy imported from The Pacific Region of NationStates

*&quot; The 01000010 01101111 01101001 of United Arkadia is a massive, cultured nation, ruled by Morgan and Victoria Whitehall with an iron fist, and remarkable for its parental licensing program, irreverence towards religion, and absence of drug laws. The compassionate, hard-working, cynical population of 1.041 billion Pacific Arkadians are ruled by a mostly-benevolent dictator, who grants the populace the freedom to live their own lives but watches carefully for anyone to slip up.

The medium-sized, corrupt government juggles the competing demands of Education, Defense, and Welfare. The average income tax rate is 50.2%, and even higher for the wealthy. 

The frighteningly efficient United Arkadian economy, worth 138 trillion Denarii a year, is broadly diversified and led by the Information Technology industry, with significant contributions from Trout Farming, Tourism, and Arms Manufacturing. Average income is an impressive 133,495 Denarii, and evenly distributed, with the richest citizens earning only 2.2 times as much as the poorest.

Genocide is seen as a topic best avoided in history lessons, unemployed mercenaries drift the country looking for new careers, bike rage is all the rage, and the recently unemployed can often be seen at the local homeless shelter. Crime, especially youth-related, is totally unknown, thanks to a capable police force and progressive social policies in education and welfare. United Arkadia's national animal is the Pacifican Eagle, which soars majestically through the nation's famously clear skies, and its national religion is Arkadian Secularism.

United Arkadia is ranked 15,716th in the world and 697th in the Pacific for Largest Cheese Export Sector, scoring 5,176.43 on the Mozzarella Productivity Index. &quot;*
