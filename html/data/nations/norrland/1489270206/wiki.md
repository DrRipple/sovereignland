*"Strive for the best!"*

## Introduction

**Solborg** is the largest and most populous Nordic country in Norrland, bordering Norsen to the west, Finnmark to the north, and Kievinki to the east. It is connected to Broenlan via a bridge-tunnel across the Ã˜resund. The countryside is largely forested, especially in the northern areas, and the climate is moderate in the summer and snowy in the winter. The country is mainly known abroad for its high standard of living and numerous technological advancements.

## Demographics

The official language of Solborg is Swedish, and about 92% of the population is fluent in English as well. Minority languages include Finnish, Norwegian, and Mandarin Chinese. A majority of the population is of Germanic descent, and the remainder is largely Latin. A sizable Chinese community exists as well, and an estimated 20% of Solborgians are mixed race.

## Government

Solborg is a democratic republic with an elected Chancellor as head of state. The legislature is composed of a single-chamber Riksdag with 500 seats. Members of the Riksdag are elected using a preferential system with muti-member districts. Currently, a coalition between the Liberal Democrats and the Democratic Socialist Union holds a majority in the Riksdag. Felix Lundgren (LDP) has served as Chancellor since March 2013.
