Etymology

The name "Ravnabbor" stems from the Norwegian language, meaning "Raven Perch," in honor of it's immortal ruler, Fylkir Raven.

The citizens of Ravnabbor are referred to as Ravnabborians, although they accept being called Scandinavians as well.

History

Ravnabbor started out as a rebel movement that arose in the city of Bergen, Norway. The leader of the rebellion was named Raven, and he sought to bring an end to the new corrupt democracy that his country had embraced, in order to bring back the old ways of Jarls ruling under a High King. The movement started peacefully, with several like minded individuals joining him and proposing their ideas to people all across Norway. After several years they managed to get a political party made, and after many years of discreet propaganda and political excellence, their party was elected. After gaining power, Raven saw that he would have to take preemptive action to stay in control of the country. He gave in to fascism, oppressing the people of Norway in order to reach a more respectable end. He changed the country's name to Ravnabbor, and with the help of the police force and the army he led an oppressive dictatorship for years. However he slowly started giving his people more rights, and while they lacked the power to vote, they were allowed to do practically anything else provided that they didn't harm other people. He repealed all drug laws, and discontinued the frequent executions and arrests that had become the norm. The people of Norway had already been subjugated at this point, and served the state with absolute loyalty and reverence. Sweden, Denmark and Finland had remained neutral the whole time, and all the while Ravnabbor had been building it's army. High King Raven personally led his armies against all three of them, and after many hard years he managed to annex all of them. The people of Ravnabbor ensured their neighbors that they would be well treated, and very little harsh treatment was required. Over the next several years the High King continued to give people more rights, and slowly converted his Dictatorship into a Socialist nation. Several years after Ravnabbor became a beacon of Socialism, it's now devout people called for a new form of government; a theocracy. This gave High King Raven even more power than he had before, and he was given the title of Fylkir, acting in similar capacity to a Pope with the additional power of King. The Jarldom remained intact, but the influence he had over Ravnabbor increased astronomically. Now he continues to serve the USSD, both as a Commissar and a Marshal; and he promises to continue doing so until his death.
