# Culture

Prussia, or Preu√üen as it is called in the traditional German, has a vibrant and unique culture. After the German unification in 1871, the German Empire (as it was known then) began to separate itself culturally from other European nations. Germans (again, as they were known then) enjoyed different music, theater, and customs than their typically similar neighbors in Austria and Stoichia. Today, Prussian culture revolves around a few central themes: food, religion and entertainment.  

Food in Prussia typically consists of varying types of meats, with plenty of beer accompanying meals. Bratwurst (sausages), hamburgers, pretzels and potatoes are among the most common foods eaten in the country. Oktoberfest is a huge event in Prussia, (coming in the month of October), which celebrates all types of Prussian foods and, mainly, beer.

Although the number of religious adherents in Prussia has dropped significantly in recent years, the nation has always been deeply impacted by Christianity. Reformers like Martin Luther and others led the Protestant movement, which centered in what is now Prussia. Even as Prussians become increasingly more secular (just 22% of people call themselves &quot;religious&quot;), the effects of Christianity are long lasting and clearly visible in architecture, iconography and literature. 

Entertainment in Prussia can be found in all sorts of ways. Cities like Berlin and Hamburg are famed all around the world because of their night-life, and are great places to have fun while in the country. Prussians, however, have increasingly turned to things like videogames for enjoyment, with internet cafes and other gaming facilities expanding across the nation. Sports are probably the most common form of entertainment, however, especially football. It is the most popular throughout Prussia, mainly in the highly competitive cities of Greater Bavaria (i.e. Munich, Stuttgart, etc). The Bundesliga is the national football league in Prussia, and is wildly popular throughout the country. Young Prussians frequent local parks and fields to play the game with their friends.
